Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in PyTorch
===============



### Running
Run the sample code by typing:


```
./gan_pytorch.py
```

...and you'll train two nets to battle it out on a shifted/scaled Gaussian distribution. The 'fake' distribution should match the 'real' one within a reasonable time.
